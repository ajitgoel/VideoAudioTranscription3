For purposes of these Terms, ‘Confidential Information’ shall mean all non-public, confidential and proprietary information relating to the Parties, their respective clients and the Service, which has been or will be disclosed by a Party orally or as set forth in writing, or contained in some other tangible form. The receiving Party hereby agrees to hold in strict confidence and to use all reasonable efforts to maintain the secrecy of any and all Confidential Information disclosed by the disclosing Party under these Terms and may not disclose Confidential Information without the express, written prior consent of the disclosing Party, with the exception of the following:  </p>

      Upon written request of the disclosing Party, the receiving Party shall return promptly to the disclosing Party all materials and documents, as well as any data or other media (including computer data and electronic information), together with any copies thereof, or destroy said Confidential Information and upon request of the disclosing Party, provide a certificate of destruction  </p>
